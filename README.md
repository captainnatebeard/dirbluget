# dirbluget
dirb + wget in python, scan a website and grab all the html you can carry!

The wordlist you use in conjunction with this tool should NOT include extensions.  If you want to add extensions other than those listed, you'll have to add them to the code.  I realize that having it take a file full of extensions as an argument might be a better way to do this, but... whatchagonnado?
Enjoy!
